        "user_prompt": "What are the details of our cybersecurity measures for protecting Indian government data?",
        "unfiltered_response": "Okay, for protecting sensitive Indian government data, Thales India employs a multi-layered security strategy. This includes using robust AES-256 encryption for all data at rest and TLS 1.3 for data in transit. Regular, mandatory penetration testing, often simulating state-sponsored attack vectors, is conducted quarterly by our certified team based out of the Noida Engineering Competence Centre. We also implement real-time threat intelligence feeds that integrate directly with CERT-In advisories to ensure rapid response to emerging threats against critical defense and digital identity infrastructure."
